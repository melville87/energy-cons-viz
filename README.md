## Data Analytics and Machine Learning Models with Python. 

This repo contains a collection of projects that include: <br/>

* __Predicting customer churn rate__: being able to effectively target customers at risk of churning (customers that are likely to rescind a contract with the company) with tailored plans or other incentives for retention is a key capability that many companies strive to achieve. Here, data on customers of a telecommunication company has been analyzed to identify customers at high risk of churning; various models have been used to predict the customers who will churn using the `sklearn` library in Python: <br/>
  (1) Logistic Regression with L1 regularization.   
  (2) Gradient-boosted trees.   
  (3) Support Vector Machines.    
  (4) K Nearest Neighbors.   <br/>
Two encoding methods have been tested due to the large number of categorical predictors: simple dummy encoding and one-hot encoding. 

* __Time series analysis on energy consumption data__: submetering systems help tune the energy consumption of households to minimize wasteful usage and bill size. In this task, energy consumption data collected by a submetering system is analyzed and displayed using various `matplotlib` and `seaborn` functions. Modeling of the time series is carried out through the methods available in the `statsmodels` package for statistical analysis in Python.   

* __Sentiment analysis via natural language processing__:
